# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

CNNs are a form of Neural Networks which are popular for the case of image and video classification. At a high-level CNNs apply an iterative pattern recognition method which scans individual images to extract key features that attempt to capture the latent properties which make up the image. CNNs can also be used for different time-series based/sequential analysis such as text classification or time-series forecasting.
